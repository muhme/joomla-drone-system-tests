# Joomla Drone System Tests Clone

[Joomla system tests](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/4.4-dev/tests/System) uses [Drone](https://www.drone.io/) for Continuous Integration (CI). These three [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers gives the possibility to run the Joomla system tests local, from local Joomla source code folder and as far as possible as with Drone.

Simple dirty use of all what was found in [.drone.yml](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/4.4-dev/.drone.yml) and [joomla-projects/docker-images](https://github.com/joomla-projects/docker-images).

## Installation

[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and a bash scripting environment are required and must be installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/muhme/joomla-drone-system-tests
cd joomla-drone-system-tests
# put your Joomla source code in folder www, e.g.
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms www
scripts/create.sh
```
